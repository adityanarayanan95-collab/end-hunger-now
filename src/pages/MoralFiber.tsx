                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  The United Nations proposes that world hunger will cost about $3 billion per month to solve. 
                  This is important because currently it's a problem that'll never go away. That's because, 
                  in Capitalism, as everyone sells to everyone else for profit the guy at the bottom gets screwed, 
                  so no matter how big and great Capitalism gets for the majority of us the people at the bottom 
                  will forever be screwed.

                    <strong>1. Government Limitations:</strong> The government is incapable of managing the wealth 
                    inequality we have and doing anything about world hunger because the private sector is too big 
                    in comparison and is driving the wealth inequality.

                  <p>
                    <strong>2. Non-profit Limitations:</strong> Non-profits currently aim to solve this problem by 
                    selling "100 meals for $20", however as they can't take care of all world hunger, they will 
                    never be able to handle the problem in its entirety.

                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  That's why we believe the answer is in selling the end of world hunger as a subscription model, 
                  that we may be able to pay monthly (because people need food monthly) for the luxury of living 
                  in a world where nobody starves to death, us included.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-trust mb-4">Operational Framework</h3>
                <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  The company that sells the end of world hunger would manage the problem city by city. In each city, 
                  the company would take the subscription payments, buy all of the about-to-expire groceries from all 
                  the grocery stores within the city, pay grocery stores to ship the food to all of the religious 
                  institutions throughout the city, and then pay the religious institutions to cook and serve the food 
                  for all of the people. This is how the company would run operationally. And as this is done throughout 
                  the planet, world hunger's done, forever.
